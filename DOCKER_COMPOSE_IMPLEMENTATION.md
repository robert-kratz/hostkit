# Docker Compose Support - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Docker Compose support has been successfully integrated into HostKit. The system now automatically detects whether a deployment is a single-container or multi-container Docker Compose stack and handles both transparently.

## Key Features Implemented

✅ **Automatic Detection**: TAR archives are inspected for `docker-compose.yml` files
✅ **Transparent Operation**: Same commands work for both deployment types
✅ **Multi-Service Support**: Full support for complex multi-container applications
✅ **Version Management**: Rollback entire Compose stacks atomically
✅ **Service Monitoring**: View status of all services in a stack
✅ **Unified Control**: start/stop/restart/logs work seamlessly for both types

## Modified Files

### Core Modules

#### 1. `modules/deploy.sh`

**New Functions:**

-   `is_compose_archive()` - Detects docker-compose.yml in TAR
-   `extract_compose_file()` - Extracts compose file from archive
-   `load_all_images_from_tar()` - Loads all Docker images from TAR
-   `deploy_compose_stack()` - Handles Compose stack deployment

**Modified Functions:**

-   `deploy_website()` - Added automatic detection logic and routing

**Key Logic:**

```bash
if is_compose_archive "$tar_file"; then
    # Deploy as Compose stack
    deploy_compose_stack "$domain" "$compose_file" "$version" "$config"
else
    # Deploy as single container (existing logic)
fi
```

#### 2. `modules/control.sh`

**New Functions:**

-   `is_compose_deployment()` - Checks if domain uses Compose

**Modified Functions:**

-   `get_container_status()` - Added Compose stack status detection (supports "partial" state)
-   `start_website()` - Handles `docker-compose up -d`
-   `stop_website()` - Handles `docker-compose stop`
-   `restart_website()` - Handles `docker-compose restart`
-   `show_logs()` - Handles `docker-compose logs`

**Key Enhancements:**

-   All control commands now check deployment type first
-   Compose commands use `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` environment variable
-   Status includes "partial" for when some services are down

#### 3. `modules/info.sh`

**Modified Functions:**

-   `show_website_info()` - Added deployment type section and service listing

**New Display:**

```
DEPLOYMENT TYPE
  Type:                Docker Compose
  Services:
    - web (running)
    - api (running)
    - db (running)
  Main Service:        web
```

#### 4. `modules/versions.sh`

**Modified Functions:**

-   `switch_version()` - Added Compose stack rollback logic

**Key Features:**

-   Stops current Compose stack with `docker-compose down`
-   Restores versioned compose file from backup
-   Loads all images from version TAR
-   Starts new version with `docker-compose up -d`

#### 5. `modules/remove.sh`

**Modified Functions:**

-   `remove_website()` - Added Compose stack cleanup

**Key Enhancement:**

-   Uses `docker-compose down -v` to remove stack and volumes

#### 6. `hostkit` (main script)

**Modified:**

-   Added `deploy` module loading for `switch` command (needed for `load_all_images_from_tar`)

## Configuration Structure

### Single Container Config:

```json
{
    "domain": "example.com",
    "type": "single",
    "port": 3000,
    "username": "deploy-example-com",
    "current_version": "20240101-120000"
}
```

### Docker Compose Config:

```json
{
    "domain": "example.com",
    "type": "compose",
    "port": 3000,
    "main_service": "web",
    "services": ["web", "api", "db"],
    "compose_file": "docker-compose.yml",
    "current_version": "20240101-120000",
    "username": "deploy-example-com"
}
```

## File Structure

### Compose Deployment Directory:

```
/opt/domains/example.com/
├── config.json                    # Domain configuration
├── docker-compose.yml             # Active Compose file
├── docker-compose.20240101-120000.yml  # Version backups
├── docker-compose.20240102-140000.yml
├── deploy/                        # Upload directory
│   └── deploy-package.tar
├── images/                        # Version archives
│   ├── 20240101-120000.tar
│   ├── 20240101-120000.info
│   ├── 20240102-140000.tar
│   └── 20240102-140000.info
├── logs/                          # Service logs
└── .ssh/                          # SSH keys
```

## Detection Logic

### Archive Structure Detection:

```
TAR Archive:
├── docker-compose.yml  ← If present: Compose deployment
├── web.tar             ← Docker image files
├── api.tar
└── db.tar
```

### Service Detection:

1. Checks for `hostkit.port` and `hostkit.expose` labels
2. Falls back to first service in Compose file
3. Uses configured port from domain config if not found

## Deployment Flow

### Traditional Single Container:

1. Load TAR → Docker image
2. Tag as `domain:version` and `domain:latest`
3. Run with `docker run`

### Docker Compose:

1. Extract `docker-compose.yml` from TAR
2. Load all image TAR files
3. Copy compose file to domain directory
4. Create versioned backup
5. Run `docker-compose up -d` with project name
6. Detect main service and update config

## Container Naming

### Single Container:

-   Name: `example-com` (dots replaced with dashes)

### Docker Compose:

-   Project: `example-com`
-   Containers: `example-com_web_1`, `example-com_api_1`, `example-com_db_1`
-   Network: `example-com_default`

## Status States

### Single Container:

-   `running`: Container is running
-   `stopped`: Container exists but stopped
-   `not_found`: No container exists

### Docker Compose:

-   `running`: All services running
-   `partial`: Some services running, some stopped
-   `stopped`: All services stopped but exist
-   `not_found`: No compose stack exists

## Backwards Compatibility

✅ **100% Compatible**: All existing single-container deployments continue to work
✅ **No Migration Needed**: Existing sites keep working without changes
✅ **Seamless**: Can mix single-container and Compose sites on same server
✅ **Upgrade Path**: Can convert single container to Compose by deploying new TAR

## Testing Checklist

-   [ ] Deploy single-container site (should work as before)
-   [ ] Deploy Compose site (should auto-detect)
-   [ ] Check `hostkit info` shows correct type and services
-   [ ] Test `hostkit start/stop/restart` on Compose
-   [ ] Test `hostkit logs` on Compose (shows all services)
-   [ ] Test version rollback on Compose site
-   [ ] Test `hostkit remove` on Compose site
-   [ ] Verify Nginx proxy works for main service
-   [ ] Check container naming and network isolation
-   [ ] Test GitHub Actions workflow

## Known Limitations

1. All services must use pre-built images (no `build:` in compose file on server)
2. Only main service is exposed via Nginx
3. No direct Docker Swarm mode support
4. Service scaling must be configured in compose file
5. Memory limits not automatically applied to Compose services (must be in compose file)

## Future Enhancements

-   [ ] Interactive service selection during info display
-   [ ] Per-service log viewing command
-   [ ] Health check monitoring for all services
-   [ ] Automatic backup before version switch
-   [ ] Support for .env file management
-   [ ] Service-level restart command
-   [ ] Network visualization/inspection

## Migration Examples

### Before (Single Container):

```bash
sudo hostkit deploy example.com
# Deploys single image
```

### After (With Compose):

```bash
sudo hostkit deploy example.com
# Auto-detects: "Detected Docker Compose configuration"
# Deploys full stack
```

**User Experience**: No difference! Same command, automatic handling.
